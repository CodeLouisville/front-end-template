    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>We are a middle class couple from Louisville, Kentucky. Our interests are pool, food, and shopping. Louis travels to pool tournaments around the country. He also helps install Diamond pool tables. I work a full-time clerical night job.</p>

    <h2>Downtown Nashville, Tn</h2>
    
    <h3>Our first trip begins in Downtown Nashville Tennessee. We were both pretty stressed out with Covid, Money, Life. I am sure most people can relate. We had not been away somewhere that didn't involve pool for a long time, so my brilliant boyfriend, Louis, suggested we go to Nashville. 
        
        <p>I planned the trip the week before. Which really just involved reserving a hotel room and looking up attractions in Nashvile. The following is our awesome adventure in Music City, U.S.A.</p>

    <h4>For our stay, I chose the <a href="https://www.hotels.com/ho1125702240/drury-plaza-hotel-nashville-downtown-nashville-united-states-of-america/" target="_blank" >Drury Plaza Hotel Nasvhille Downtown</a>. I compared several hotels online, but I liked the options and price of this hotel.</h4>

         <h5>Hotel</h5>
        
        <p>It included free breakfast, happy hour drinks, and most importantly in Nashville, had attached parking. The breakfast was excellent, but carrying it back to the room for privacy was a pain. You were given 3 drinks for happy hour that you redeemed in an attached area to the bar. I chose a margarita which was excellent. There were 2 other options which I cannot recall. My boyfriend rarely drinks, so no help there. The attached parking  garage was an additional $20.00 a night, but in Downtown Nashville, it was worth it.</p>
            
        <p>I chose a king suite. It had a lounge area and bedroom separated by the large bathroom. The bathroom had a separate soaking tub and shower, as well as a toilet closet. The bed was comfortable and having separate areas was great since Lou wanted to sleep in. We had a small fridge, but to my extreme despair, no coffee maker. We had also wanted a balcony, but they do not have attached balconies. There is an outdoor lounge.</p>

            <li><a href="https://bobs-steakandchop.com/nashville/" target="_blank" >Bob's Steak & Chop house</a><p>Most amazing steak I have ever had! The baked potato was huge and the special carrot they serve is delicious! Pricey, but worth it.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://peglegporker.com/"target="_blank">Peg Leg Parker</a><p>Casual and reasonably priced. Dry rubbed ribs were amazing and half a slab fed my boyfriend and me. We were not impressed by the side items we ordered, macaroni and cheese and green beans.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://fivedaughtersbakery.com/"target="_blank">Five Daughters Bakery</a><p>They have a 100 layer donut - enough said, right? It was filled with cream, which was too much for Louis, but my sweet tooth adored. They have a good selection including keto and glutton-free options. Be prepared for a line!</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://frothymonkey.com/"target="_blank">Frothy Monkey</a><p>An early morning jaunt sent me in search of good coffee. I had an espresso and it was quite good. They did seem to have a varied selection, but I am traditional with my coffee.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://jenis.com/scoop-shops/jenis-nashville-farmers-market/"target="_blank">Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams</a><p>This was a indulgence at the Farmer's Market. Pricey, but so good. I had two scoops (that sweet tooth again!) and Louis had one. They have unusual flavors, but very creamy and amazing.</p></li>
