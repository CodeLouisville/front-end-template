# Michelle and Lou's Awesome Travel Website

## Description
```
First Travel Website created for final project of Treehouse/BU Front End Development class

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. "sticky" class located in the body, near h1. 
Sticky class makes it possible for my Website description 
first navigation to stay on screen as the user scrolls through
the web pages.

2. "dropdown" class is also located in the main body in my first
unordered list. This button allows me to position and create a dropdown
menu in my stick banner that will list the cities in the website.

3. "dropbutton" class is also located in the main body in my first unordered
list. This button is my home button that will allow users to go back to the start of 
the webpage.



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. The window.addEventListener was how I created my sticky banner that stays in place as 
users scroll through the website. 

2. The window.onclick function was how I created my dropdown box in my sticky header. Users will be able to click the box and see a list of cities to choose from when the website is complete.
