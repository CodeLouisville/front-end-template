    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>We are a middle class couple from Louisville, Kentucky. Our interests are pool, food, and shopping. Louis travels to pool tournaments around the country. He also helps install Diamond pool tables. I work a full-time clerical night job.</p>

    <h3>Our first trip begins in Downtown Nashville Tennessee. We were both pretty stressed out with Covid, Money, Life. I am sure most people can relate. We had not been away somewhere that didn't involve pool for a long time, so my brilliant boyfriend, Louis, suggested we go to Nashville. 
        
        <p></p>I planned the trip the week before. Which really just involved reserving a hotel room and looking up attractions in Nashvile. The following is our awesome adventure in Music City, U.S.A.</p>

    <h4>For our stay, I chose the Drury Plaza Hotel Nasvhille Downtown. I compared several hotels online, but I liked the options and price of this hotel. 
         <h5>Hotel</h5>
     </h4>   
        <p>It included free breakfast, happy hour drinks, and most importantly in Nashville, had attached parking. The breakfast was excellent, but carrying it back to the room for privacy was a pain. You were given 3 drinks for happy hour that you redeemed in an attached area to the bar. I chose a margarita which was excellent. There were 2 other options which I cannot recall. My boyfriend rarely drinks, so no help there. The attached parking  garage was an additional $20.00 a night, but in Downtown Nashville, it was worth it.</p>
            
        <p>I chose a king suite. It had a lounge area and bedroom separated by the large bathroom. The bathroom had a separate soaking tub and shower, as well as a toilet closet. The bed was comfortable and having separate areas was great since Lou wanted to sleep in. We had a small fridge, but to my extreme despair, no coffee maker.</p>
